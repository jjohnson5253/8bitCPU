In this project, I implemented an 8-bit CPU in Verilog HDL.  I implemented the Verilog with Altera's Quartus II software.  
The software created a circuit with my Verilog code on a terasIC DE0 board which is an FPGA. 
A report I wrote on the project for class is in the report directory.
The Verilog files and other files are located in the Verilog directory.  The other files were generated when I created and
ran this project in the Quartus II software.

Verilog is a hardware-descriptive language (HDL) so I had to work around some problems I could have solved with an ordinary 
programming language like C/C++.  While building the CPU, I learned about finite state machines (FSM's), registers, 
synchronous processing, and memory.
